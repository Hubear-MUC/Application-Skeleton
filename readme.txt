Application skeleton 0.0
------------------------

This is a first attempt to establish a code skeleton that can be extended by the functional code of an application.

Unfortunately the 183 bytes of available code space so far was just big enough to cover a simple skeletion for an application running in a shell.

So this program does not really work in a satisfying way yet, thus the version number 0.0. At least leaving the empty "application" by entering

  0
  
at its prompt works already.

With gaining about 250 to 300 bytes of available code space first attempts of user interaction could be tried out hopefully.

It is planned to use this in the next time for writing applications for doing calculations coming up with further applications for neccessary calculations I need to do.


Version history:
----------------

Version 0.0

Initial implementation

A real test for this has to take place when the code space extends to about 250 bytes beacuse the 183 bytes available yet are completely used up by the application skeletion yet.
